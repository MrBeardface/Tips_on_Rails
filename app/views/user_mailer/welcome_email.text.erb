Welcome to Tips on Rails
==============================

Hey <%= @user.username %>,

We designed  Tips on Rails to be a one-stop shop for increasing your knowledge
about Ruby on Rails. It’s our focus to create a unique environment where Rails
developers can share their tips about everything Rails. It's built for you and
run by you. We hope that with your help we can build a library of detailed tips
about every aspect of Rails development.

To get the most out of Tips on Rails, dive right in and start adding tips.
If you feel like you’ve got nothing to offer at this time, check out other Rails
developers' tips and bookmark them! You’ll find something to spark your interest
for sure.

You have tips. We have tips. Let's put them on Rails.
